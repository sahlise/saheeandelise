            <p>I walked into my first day of my first Computer Science class at UW La-Crosse with the goal of finding some friends in the same major as me. I got to class a little early, sat down, and waited for someone to sit by me to initiate conversation. However, that day, no one talked to me, and I remember feeling like I had made a mistake in the major that I chose, that I was over my head.</p>

It was a good day of class. On the second day, I sat in the same spot. But someone (hint: Elise) came to sit in the seat next to me. We talked and established each other as amicable teammates for future class projects. Somewhere along the way, homework turned into dinner, and dinner turned into a date. All in all, she is the best classmate you could ever ask for.</p>

          <p className="p-3">Months later, Elise had just come back from a trip to Cleveland, OH with her parents. Sahee seemed unusually distracted that evening. He suggested getting dressed up and going to dinner, but all Elise wanted was a cozy night in with frozen pizza. After dinner, Sahee suggested a walk, and Elise agreed. Elise saw a lump in Sahee&apos;s pocket and joked that it was a ring box, but it was actually a pair of socks that Sahee pulled out and put on.</p>
          <p className="p-3">As we were heading out the door, Elise saw the lump in Sahee&apos;s pocket again and made a joke about Sahee bringing an extra pair of socks on the walk, while tapping the lump. Turns out the lump this time was a ring box, and Sahee proposed to Elise on the spot in the apartment. Elise&apos;s joyful &quot;yes&quot; was followed by a walk where Sahee proposed again, this time at the originally intended romantic spot.</p>
