            <p>I walked into my first day of my first Computer Science class at UW La-Crosse with the goal of finding some friends in the same major as me. I got to class a little early, sat down, and waited for someone to sit by me to initiate conversation. However, that day, no one talked to me, and I remember feeling like I had made a mistake in the major that I chose, that I was over my head.</p>

It was a good day of class. On the second day, I sat in the same spot. But someone (hint: Elise) came to sit in the seat next to me. We talked and established each other as amicable teammates for future class projects. Somewhere along the way, homework turned into dinner, and dinner turned into a date. All in all, she is the best classmate you could ever ask for.</p>
