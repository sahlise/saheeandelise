          <p>I walked into my first day of my first Computer Science class at UW La-Crosse with the goal of finding some friends in the same major as me. I got to class a little early, sat down, and waited for someone to sit by me to initiate conversation. However, that day, no one talked to me, and I remember feeling like I had made a mistake in the major that I chose, that I was over my head.</p>

          <p>Class after class, we continued to talk before and after, learning about each other's lives little by little.

Luckily, after working on a class project, I stealthily found out that my CS friend's name was Sahee ðŸ™‚. After a few months, Sahee and I were basically inseparable, and by the end of the semester, we decided to start dating.</p>

        <h1>Sahee's Point of View</h1>
        <p>On the first day of my intro CS class, I decided to sit in the second row because I didn't want to sit in the front but didn't want to sit in the back. It was a good day of class. On the second day, I sat in the same spot. But someone (hint: Elise) came to sit in the seat next to me. We talked and established each other as amicable teammates for future class projects. Somewhere along the way, homework turned into dinner, and dinner turned into a date. All in all, she is the best classmate you could ever ask for.</p>
